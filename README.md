Encryption Cyphers project for university.

This program is a simple C# WinForms application that implements the Vernam, Vigenere and a  Columnar Transposition encryption algorithm.
The Vernam algorithm save output to a file, but can encrypt strings, text files and binary files.
The Vineg√©re algorithm has been modified to allow the user to specify the character set to work with.
The Columnar Transposition algorithm allows the user to enter an unlimited list of keys wich will be used synchronisely to encrypt the plaintext.

There is no license to use this, but be aware that if I lose marks due to your selfishness, I will be very hurt...
